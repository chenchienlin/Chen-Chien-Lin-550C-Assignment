2. Addition and multiplication of two complex numbers are created.
3. Methods which can perform two arrays and two matrices multiplication are defined in this class.
&ensp;* Two input arrays must be made of complex numbers and cannot be null.
&ensp;* Two input matrices must be matrices made of complex numbers and cannot be null.
